# Resource Blocker

Resource Blocker is a web-based application designed to simplify resource management for IT companies. The application allows users to easily manage and track the inventory of various IT resources such as laptops, monitors, keyboards, LAN wires, and headphones.

Resource Blocker works by allowing users to request for a specific resource through a simple and intuitive web interface. These requests are then reviewed and approved by an IT personnel, and the requested resource is allocated to the employee from the available inventory.

The application also maintains a detailed history of all resource allocation transactions, allowing for easy tracking and forecasting of future resource needs. Additionally, the application supports role-based access control for administrators and users, ensuring that only authorized personnel can manage and allocate resources.

One of the key features of Resource Blocker is its ability to block certain resources that are currently not available. This ensures that the inventory is accurately reflected, and that users are not able to request for resources that are currently unavailable. Resource Blocker provides a simple yet effective solution for IT companies looking to manage their resources more efficiently.
